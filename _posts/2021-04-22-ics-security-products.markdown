Many discussion threads in ICS security internet forums are people asking for product recommendations. There is normally good response to this type of posts, but they all exist in little silos, dotted around the interent which makes them hard to find.

The community effort [ICS Security Products](https://github.com/S3cur1tyH4ggis/ICS-Security-Products) is an attempt to solve the problem of knowing where to go to find out about useful products in the ICS security space. The purpose of the project is to list ICS security products as a community resource. Please contribute if you have something useful to add.
